## Color converters
We recommend the using the first one (marked with a star ⭐).

| Link | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ⭐ [wplaceconverter.com](https://wplaceconverter.com/) | Simple converter tool with Dither, color selection, and picking options. |
| [pepoafonso.github.io/color_converter_wplace](https://pepoafonso.github.io/color_converter_wplace/) | Allows for rescaling of uploaded images, it's not as precise as the previous option though. Allows color choice. Includes options for dithering. The only open source option. |
| [wplace.org](https://wplace.org/) | Has more in-depth dithering and scaling conversion options. This tool tends to give the best color results, but the image may be larger than expected. |
| [wplacepixel.com](https://wplacepixel.com/) | A tool that is better for smaller images to rescale. Dithering is not included. |
| [wplace.life/image-to-pixel](https://wplace.life/image-to-pixel) | An alternative to the previous option. It has similar functions. Dithering is not included. |

### What's dithering & how does it work?
Dithering helps making a picture look smoother. 

Dithering works by tricking the eye - instead of showing one exact color that might not exist in a limited palette, dithering places small dots of two (or more) available colors next to each other. From a distance, your eyes blend them together into the missing color or a smooth gradient.

Without dithering:<br></br>
<div className="small-image">
