# How to fix the map?
When you're zooming in or out, different parts of the map appear or dissapear. This is really annoying, especially when you zoom into a place where you want to draw, and that part of the map just dissapears.

To fix it:
1. [Install TamperMonkey](installing-tampermonkey)
2. Install the script: [Click on me to install](https://gist.github.com/RoootTheFox/e00ee6603adc16a728a0b478b8d71d09/raw/e781f0394c1163f2158d439b973d688651e05d40/bluemarble-fixed.user.js)
3. Reload your Wplace.live tab (if you had one open)

If you're using Blue Marble, you'll have to [install a patched version](https://github.com/RoootTheFox/wplace-plusplus/raw/refs/heads/main/wplace++.user.js) of it (or else the map will not load at all)
