# Introduction


## What's Wplace?
Wplace.live is an online collaborative art board where everyone can add one pixel every 30 seconds to a giant world map. It’s a project inspired by Reddit’s r/Place.

## What are Droplets?
Droplets are the virtual currency, used to purchase items in [the shop](/beginners/shop), as well as premium colors.

## How do I earn droplets?
You earn 1 Droplet for every pixel you place, and 500 every time you level up.

You can also buy them for real life money.

## What are premium colors?

By default, you can only access a pallete of 32 colors, including "transparent," but in the expanded pallete, there are 32 additional colors that can each be unlocked by spending 2,000 droplets.
